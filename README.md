# 📌 Overview

This repository contains my Cybersecurity Incident Analysis portfolio project completed as part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
The purpose of this project is to analyze a simulated cybersecurity incident, investigate potential indicators of compromise (IOCs), examine system logs, and determine the root cause and impact of the incident. The project mirrors what an entry-level cybersecurity analyst would perform in a real SOC (Security Operations Center) environment.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

This incident analysis demonstrates the ability to:

- Review and analyze logs to detect suspicious activity

- Identify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

- Investigate the root cause of a security incident

- Assess affected systems, accounts, and data

- Document findings using standard incident reporting formats

- Recommend mitigation and prevention steps

- Apply common cybersecurity frameworks and methodologies

# 🧩 Scenario Summary

This project focuses on a fictional organization that has detected unusual activity in its systems. The tasks included:

- Analyzing firewall logs, system logs, and authentication logs

- Identifying unauthorized access attempts

- Reviewing suspicious IP connections

- Mapping IOCs to potential threat actors or techniques

- Determining the timeline of the incident using event correlation

- Evaluating the security impact on the organization

This provides hands-on experience similar to real-world SOC investigations.

# 📝 Methods & Techniques

This project uses a structured cybersecurity investigation approach:

1. Detection & Initial Review

Examined security alerts

Identified suspicious events and connections

2. Log Analysis

Reviewed authentication logs for failed and successful attempts

Analyzed firewall logs for unauthorized traffic

Inspected system logs for anomalies and process activity

3. Incident Reconstruction

Built a timeline of attacker activity

Mapped login attempts, privilege escalations, and data access patterns

4. IOC Identification

Extracted suspicious IPs, file names, user accounts, and hash values

Compared findings against known threat intelligence sources

5. Impact Assessment

Evaluated compromised accounts or systems

Determined whether data was accessed or exfiltrated

6. Recommendations

Suggested short-term and long-term remediation steps

Provided security hardening measures based on NIST CSF & CIS Controls

# 🛠️ Tools, Skills & Frameworks

Log analysis

Security alert interpretation

Threat intelligence lookup

Event correlation

Root cause analysis
